## Getting Started
We recommend setting up a virtual environment. Using e.g. Anaconda run as administration, the `depth_pro` package can be installed via:

```bash
cd /target/folder
conda create -n depth-pro-win-cpu -y python=3.9
conda activate depth-pro-win-cpu
git clone https://github.com/lattebyte/DepthPro-Windows-CPU.git
pip install -e .
```

To download pretrained checkpoints follow the steps below:
```bash
# create directory
mkdir checkpoints
```
Then, manually download model by entering the following into web browser:
https://ml-site.cdn-apple.com/models/depth-pro/depth_pro.pt

Once completed, move `depth_pro.pt` into `checkpoints`


### Running from python

```bash
python cpu_img_inference.py
```

### Depth Pro: Sharp Monocular Metric Depth in Less Than a Second

This software project accompanies the research paper:

We present a foundation model for zero-shot metric monocular depth estimation. Our model, Depth Pro, synthesizes high-resolution depth maps with unparalleled sharpness and high-frequency details. The predictions are metric, with absolute scale, without relying on the availability of metadata such as camera intrinsics. And the model is fast, producing a 2.25-megapixel depth map in 0.3 seconds on a standard GPU. These characteristics are enabled by a number of technical contributions, including an efficient multi-scale vision transformer for dense prediction, a training protocol that combines real and synthetic datasets to achieve high metric accuracy alongside fine boundary tracing, dedicated evaluation metrics for boundary accuracy in estimated depth maps, and state-of-the-art focal length estimation from a single image.


The model in this repository is a reference implementation, which has been re-trained. Its performance is close to the model reported in the paper but does not match it exactly.
